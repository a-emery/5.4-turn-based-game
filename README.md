# 5.4-turn-based-game

This assignment was my first in-depth JavaScript project. This was a group project, which presented some of its own challenges, but offered many benefits as well.  I wrote most of the JavaScript for this assignment and did very little design. The goal of this assignment was to build a turn based game using JavaScript constructors and prototypes. This project was the first time I started to feel comfortable chaining JavaScript functions.
